\usage{
calculate_and_plot_conditional_probabilities(
  filtered_df,
  rfe_bin_edges,
  count_filter = 10
)
}
\arguments{
\item{filtered_df}{A data frame containing rainfall data with columns "rainfall" and "rfe".}

\item{rfe_bin_edges}{A numeric vector defining the edges of RFE bins.}

\item{count_filter}{A numeric value specifying the minimum count required for a bin to be included in the results (default is 10).}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{filtered_probabilities_df}: A data frame with conditional probabilities, mean and std of rainfall, and rainy/dry day probabilities by RFE bin.
\item \code{p0}: Probability of rainfall > 0 when RFE is zero.
\item \code{p0_rainyday}: Probability of rainfall > 0 for rainy days when RFE is zero.
\item \code{p0_dryday}: Probability of rainfall > 0 for dry days when RFE is zero.
}
}
\description{
This function calculates conditional probabilities of rainfall based on
ranges of rainfall estimates (RFE) and generates statistical summaries for
each bin, including probability of rainy and dry days. Results are filtered
to exclude bins with a low number of observations.
