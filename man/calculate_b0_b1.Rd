\title{Calculate Logistic Model Coefficients (b0, b1)}
\usage{
calculate_b0_b1(
  mean_rfe,
  conditional_prob_rain,
  bin_counts,
  min_rainy_days_threshold
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mean_rfe}{A numeric vector representing mean RFE values for each bin.}

\item{conditional_prob_rain}{A numeric vector representing conditional probabilities of rain for each bin.}

\item{bin_counts}{A numeric vector indicating the count of observations in each RFE bin.}

\item{min_rainy_days_threshold}{A numeric threshold for the minimum required total count of rainy days across bins.}
}
\value{
A named numeric vector containing \code{b0} and \code{b1} logistic model coefficients, or \code{NA} values if model fitting fails.
}
\description{
Estimates the coefficients b0 and b1 for a logistic model based on mean rainfall estimate (RFE)
and observed conditional probabilities of rain. Returns 0 for both coefficients if the total count of rainy days is below
the specified threshold or if there are insufficient data points.
